# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Stage time tracking, delay indicators & proactive follow-up - Phase 1

- Added minimal `Contract` and `Logistics` entities (the lifecycle
  previously stopped at a won Bid) and a generic `stage_milestones` table
  for acceptance/payment/shipment milestones.
- Added `stage_history`, one polymorphic append-only table recording every
  status/stage/waiting-on/hold transition across Opportunity,
  DealRegistration, Bid, Lot, ChecklistItem, Contract and Logistics.
- Added `hold_periods` (pause-the-clock support with a required reason),
  `holiday_calendar` (seeded with best-effort 2026 Ethiopian public
  holidays - movable Easter/Islamic-calendar dates flagged "estimated,
  verify") and `working_week_config` (Mon-Sat by default, admin-editable).
- Extended key-date change tracking (reusing the existing `audit_log`
  table) to Bid's `openingAt`/`clarificationDeadline`, Opportunity's
  `expectedTenderDate`, and DealRegistration's `submittedDate`/
  `approvalDate`/`expiryDate`.
- Added `StageHistoryBackfillRunner`, an idempotent startup job that
  replays real history for existing Bids/Lots and seeds a synthetic entry
  for Opportunities/DealRegistrations still in their very first stage,
  leaving anything else unseeded ("unknown") rather than fabricating zero.
- New REST endpoints: `/api/contracts`, `/api/logistics`,
  `/api/stage-history`, `/api/stage-clock`, `/api/holds`.
- No UI yet (indicators, the Deal 360 timeline, and the admin screens for
  targets/holidays/working week all land in phase 2).
